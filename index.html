                    <h3>Personal Description</h3>
                    <p>My name is Patrick, 29, still a student,
                        I design and build computer programs that power
                        mobile devices as well as desktop computer devices
                         looking for a part time job I can do while still at school, ideally working remotely. I’m skilled with PHP and Java, and I am trying to learn other programming languages, step by step. Have two brothers, both of them study at a med school, so it is quite funny that I, as a girl, decided for software engineering. I try to get the most out of my time at the college, and have some edge once I graduate, which is the primary reason why I seek a part time job with you.

                        <h3>Shopping Cart</h3>
                        <p>Electronic systems are sometimes used by retailers. Each shopping cart is fitted with an electronic locking wheel clamp, or "boot".[34] A transmitter with a thin wire is placed around the perimeter of the parking lot, and the boot locks when the cart leaves the designated area. Store personnel must then deactivate the lock with a handheld remote control to return the cart to stock. Often, a line is painted in front of the broadcast range to warn customers that their cart will stop when rolled past the line. However, these systems are very expensive to install and although helpful, are not foolproof. The wheels can be lifted over the electronic barrier and/or pushed hard enough that the locks break.</p>
